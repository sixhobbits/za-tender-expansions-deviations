operational commodity that is required for compliance with the FFFR
Regulations during units light up and shutdown, mill changes, combustion
support on low loads and for emergencies (Unit capabilities, low coal bunker
levels due to coal shortages and wet coal, BFPT & EFP’s not available). low
coal bunker levels due to coal shortages and wet coal, BFPT & EFP’s not

2) running on 3 mills since yesterday. The issue started when we received wet
coal, the units were supported with oil burners in order stabilise the
combustion and this has resultant on high fuel oil consumption. The situation
persisted to the point where we lost the two running units at South (units1 and
2). The above said challenges has depleted the South fuel oil tank to the
critical level where we will be challenged to return these two units and at the
state where the fuel oil pumps will suck sludge and causing the serious
damage to the other parts of the plant. In order to avert an undesirable
situation, extra fuel oil 10 loads were requested as per the daily activities from
the National contract (4600071904, 4600071906 and 4600071906) through the
Contract’s Manager, unfortunately our request could not be accommodated
due to high fuel oil usage through the generation fleet and due to restricted
number of daily loads allocation. For today the station was allocated 6 loads.
The urgent procurement process is to order extra fuel oil tankers outside the
