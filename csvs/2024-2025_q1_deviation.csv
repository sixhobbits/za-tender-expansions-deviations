cooperative agreement in terms of which a basket of services are rendered. This
agreement is colloquially referred to as the SABC Umbrella agreement. Flowing from
the umbrella agreement are six service charters that are agreed to and signed between
the SABC and the Electoral Commission. The service charters articulate the outputs,
deliverables, timeframes and obligations of each of the parties.
The charters give expression to the constitutional mandates of both the SABC and the
Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission is constitutionally enjoined to ensure
free and fair elections. This, the Electoral Commission achieves by promoting
knowledge of sound and democratic electoral processes, promoting conditions
conducive to free and fair elections and promoting voter education. The Electoral
Commission recognises the mass reach of radio and television as preferred platforms
for citizens to access information. There is extended access through digital platforms
that SABC provides for the public as hubs of information and education. This research
based approach, based on the longitude study of HSRC as released in 2022, informs
the choice of structured civic and democracy education over radio and television
platforms.
The SABC delivers its public mandate to educate via a business unit known as SABC
Education. The unit provides content on both radio and television.
The SABC now reaches 26.8 million people through 19 radio stations and six
television stations.
It is estimated that viewers spend on average three hours a day watching SABC
television channels.
For the majority of rural people and illiterate people radio and television remain the
most available and widespread medium of receiving information. With radio in the first
place.
It is submitted that the SABC is a sole supplier in that it (SABC) possess unique and
singularly available capacity to meet the requirements of the Electoral Commission.
Reasons in support of sole supplier status of the SABC
Radio and television are a popular medium amongst South African. In a study
conducted by the HSRC in 2021 (Voter Participation Survey) read together with
Longitudinal Study of 2022, it is revealed that television and radio are effective",2024/03/25,2024/04/01,2029/03/31,Reported,,

new system has been built for NPE 2024.
The PFMA SCM Instruction NO. 09 Of 2022/2023 prescribes that the Accounting
officers and accounting authorities must publish open competitive bids on the e-Tender
Portal, for at least 21 days, except in urgent cases when bids may be advertised for
such shorter period as the accounting officer or accounting authority may determine.
The Electoral Commission, on 13 November 2023, ran a competitive bid process for
the Results System Audit, tender number IEC/ICT-04/2023. The tender closed on 8
December 2023. At closure, only two (2) bids were received. Both bids were
disqualified and as a result, the tender had to be cancelled.
A second competitive bid process for the Results System Audit ran on 16 February
2024, tender number IEC/ICT-01/2024. Five (5) bids were received, one (1)
disqualified during primary compliance verification and four (4) during the secondary
evaluation on 19 March 2024.

obliged to establish a network of voting stations throughout the country, which is is
used to conduct electoral activities.
With the current situation around unstable power supply and frequent power outages
due to load shedding or dameges to the power infrastructure it is necessary to take
precautionary steps to ensure that all voting stations are equipped with some form of
alternative or emergency lighting.
Apart from that, some voting stations currently do not have an existing supply of power
and it is, therefore, necessary to ensure acceptable operational conditions to enable
voting activities on 29 May 2024 as well as during 27 and 28 May 2024 when special
votes are cast across the country.
Irrespective of the best effort intended through the collaboration with Eskom, the latter
cannot commit to continuous power supply over the election period as load shedding
may be necessitated for the maintenance or repairs to electricity generation plants.
It is particularly noticeable that the country has been without load shedding for a
number of weeks at present. This is a significant achievement for Eskom over the past
number of years. However, the strain it places on power generation plants, especially
with the upcoming winter season, cannot be overlooked as that could lead to
significant power outages in future which may include the critical period at the end of
May 2024 during month which the elections are held.
Limited time is left in preparation for NPE 2024 which does not allow for an adequate
window period to advertise a tender for the prescribed minimum period of 21 days
since it is no longer possible to close, evaluate and award a new tender in time to allow
for delivery before voting commences on 29 May 2024. Hence we have requested to
advertise a tender on an urgent basis for a period shorter than the required 21 days.",Not indicated,Not indicated,Not indicated,Reported,,
