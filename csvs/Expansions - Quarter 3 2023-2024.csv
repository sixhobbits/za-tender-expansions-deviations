Fund and ABSA Bank in respect of account verification services (avs) for
a period of eighteen (18) months.",ABSA Bank,"In terms of the PFMA, internal control measures should be implemented in the
payment of benefits process to avoid paying the incorrect clients. As a result,
the Fund entered into a Service Level Agreement with ABSA to verify all
clients banking details. The existing contract with ABSA commenced on 23
June 2020. The AVS contract was awarded to the ABSA for a period of three
(3) years and will come to an end on 22 June 2023.
In the event where the contract with the service provider comes to an end in
June 2023 and a new service provider is appointed, there should be extensive
system developments which includes amongst others the interface between
the potential service provider and the Computron system. This may be a
serious hindrance to the verification process as currently, due to the existing
terms of the Computron system contract, no developments may be made on
the system. Consultation has been done with ICT and the advice provided
was that there may not be any other alternative but to extend the contract
with ABSA until the “go live” with SAP. The Fund will not be able to process
benefit payments without the verification of the bank accounts of beneficiaries
when a different service provider is approved.","R 2 924 949,00","R 2 154 600,00",R -,2020/06/20,2020/06/20,2024/12/19

day to day cleaning services for a period not exceeding one (1) month.",Powerful Cleaning Projects,"The extension of the contract with Powerful Cleaning and Projects (PTY) LTD
will be for a further period of one (1) month to allow for the quotation process
and appointment of a service provider to render day to day cleaning services
for the period of six (6) month on the basis that the tender process is still to
be finalized in order to appoint a new service provider on long term contract.
The BSC recommended the approval of the specification on 6 July 2023. The
specification was referred to the Probity team for review on 7 July 2023. The
extension period will become effective from 10 August 2023 and come to an
end on 11 September 2023.
The remaining tender administrative process inclusive of advertising,
evaluation, adjudication, contracting and appointment of the successful bidder
will take up to six (6) calendar months owing to Legal Services and Account
Officer’s approval timelines. However, due to the fact that the current contract
of day to cleaning services period will expire before finalization of the
contracting and appointment process, it is imperative that continuation of
services runs uninterrupted due to the nature of the services required. The
Fund does not have the necessary capacity to carry out this function internally
meanwhile the tender process is still unfolding.
According to Facilities regulations made under the repeal machinery and
Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1983 and now applicable under the
occupational health and safety act of 1993, section 9 state that every
employer shall maintain all rooms and facilities which are prescribed or
provided for in terms of the provision of these regulations in a clean, hygienic,

The contract commenced on 10 August 2022 and had expired on 9 August
2023.
The Accounting officer through the Bid Adjudication Committee (BAC) has
already approved one (01) month extension of the current contract to the
value of R 261 275.11. The addendum one (01) to this effect is valid until the
09 September 2023. Given the current status of tender administrative
process, the specification is yet to be approved by the BAC, and it is not
anticipated that the entire tender administrative process could be concluded
before expiry of the one (01) month extension hence a request for the BAC to
consider a further 3 months’ extension.
