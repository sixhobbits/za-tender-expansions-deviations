risk for the entity, to go to the market for the payroll management services

the new framework and having two service providers working on the same

services and halts any delays in the implementation and on the processing
of monthly salaries, the entity has approved a deviation for a period of six

obtained at the end of May 2024 (Annexure A), which allowed the BMA to
adopt the Patterson Framework with a condition that the salary scales be
aligned to those of the Public Service. The condition of the approval required
that the Renumeration Framework as previously developed in accordance
with the Patterson Framework and pay scales be amended to aligned with
